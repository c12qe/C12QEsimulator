C12 Callisto Emulator
================================================

C12 emulator is the first quantum emulator of the future C12 quantum computers. Based on experimentally measured C12 qubit, it offers an emulator with more qubits and more availability than our quantum processors in development. It provides tools for composing quantum circuits, running simulations and comparing both the ideal and realistic outcomes.

It aims to be a companion tool for developing gate-based quantum circuits, testing them in realistic environment & studying their scaling law.

If you find any bugs or if you have any suggestions feel free to send us a mail to emulator@c12qe.com.

We are so happy and proud to let you experiment with a software that imitates new generation of quantum computers.
